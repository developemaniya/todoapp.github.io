            <h4 class="text-primary">Real Productivity</h4>
            <p>Unlike lightweight, freebie or cutesy list tools, use Todo when you have a deadline, NEED to focus, prioritize and get things done quickly–from home or school projects, to dozens of work tasks–with sub-tasks and projects.

                NEW! Calendar View. Get a better perspective of how busy your schedule is with calendar view. Tap and select the dates to filter the tasks shown below or drag and drop tasks to the calendar to assign them to a due date.
                NEW! List Rearrangement. Reorder your category lists however you prefer!
                NEW! List Icons. Choose a different icon for each of your lists.
                NEW! Quick Tip Feature. Click the “?” or use the “Tap and Hold Help” feature to learn about different functions.
                NEW! List Grouping. Visually group lists that “go together” by adding a space between your lists.
                NEW! Color Coding. Assign colors to each task list to make it easier to identify which lists you are viewing (i.e., blue for work, green for home, brown for school).
                NEW! Enhanced “Multi-Edit” Mode. Bulk-edit tasks with drag and drop.
                Start & due date. Set a date and time to both start and end tasks and don’t let another due date pass you by.
                Flexible recurring tasks. Set any task to repeat as often and as many times as necessary. Set a meeting or task for the 5th Sunday, on Mondays, every 15 days, or anywhere in between–and let the app do the work.
                Multiple task alerts. Setup dozens of alerts (starting weeks out) for your anniversary, two to prepare your presentation for class, or one each quarter to file your employee taxes–you chose, the app reminds–no limits.
                Notes. Each task can have detailed notes.
                Search. No matter how complex your projects, you can easily search to find a task.
                Drag and Drop. Move your tasks from one list or project to another with ease.
                Lists/Folders. Todo has three built-in lists:
                1) All, which compiles your tasks.
                2) Focus, so you can concentrate on what matters most.
                3) Inbox which contains task sent by others. Plus, you can create your own lists for home, church, work or whatever you prefer.
                Overdue Tasks. Overdue tasks pop up in red and in an overdue list so you can quickly see missed dates and either complete or postpone.
                Batch Editing. You can edit multiple tasks together to either complete, move or assign a date all at once.
                Custom Application Badge. Customize Todo’s application icon for the iPhone home screen to show tasks that are due or overdue.
                Filters and Sorting. Select by filter and then arrange tasks by due date, alphabetically, by tag, or context.
                Tags. You can categorize your tasks by topic (English, Physics, Shopping, Church, etc.) then select single or multiple tags to show only related items. Click English & Physics to show just school items.
                Custom Date Ranges. Sort and view task within specific dates.
                Delete Tasks. Delete a single or groups of task. Allows you to remove tasks (without having to complete them), or if you want to clean up your completed section.
                Passcode Protection. Keep your task private by setting an app passcode.</p>
            <p>ToDo List App is a kind of app that generally used to <span class="text-primary">maintain our day-to-day tasks</span> or list everything that we have to do, with the most
                 important tasks at the top of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom. It is helpful in planning our daily schedules.
